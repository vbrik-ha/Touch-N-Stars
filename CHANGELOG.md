## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Perihelion plugin: comet/asteroid non-sidereal tracking, computed live from real orbital elements. Asteroid orbits are stable enough to ship as a fixed list needing no internet at all; comet elements are fetched from MPC and refreshed automatically (or on demand via Sync Now), then cached to disk so tracking keeps working offline between syncs. Browse tab searches comets and asteroids by brightness; Position & Path shows tonight's altitude, a 10-night motion path with a real angular scale bar and drift readout, and a live framing view centered on the object's real position with the camera's actual field of view overlaid; Track offers Quick Track for immediate manual tracking (optionally re-applying the rate every 15 minutes so a long session stays accurate as the object's true rate drifts) and Add to Sequence to build a full Advanced Sequencer container (unpark, center, track, guide, imaging loop, optional meridian-flip and autofocus triggers). Predicted magnitude is cross-checked against real observer-reported brightness (COBS) where available.

### Fixed
- Perihelion: the framing view's path/"Tonight" overlay rendered in the wrong place because its canvas element defaulted to the browser's 300x150 fallback size instead of filling its container — a CSS quirk specific to `<canvas>`/`<img>`/`<video>` elements, where `position: absolute; inset: 0` alone doesn't stretch them the way it does a normal element. Also fixed a related white-screen-on-pinch-zoom issue on mobile (same root cause).
- Perihelion: the 10-night path chart's start/end date labels could overflow the card at either edge; also added a real angular scale bar and a total/per-night drift readout so the chart carries more than a bare line between two dates.

## [App6.2.0] - 2026-08-27

Summary of all changes since 6.1.2 (released in beta1-beta9, see below for the individual beta releases).

### Added
- Plugin Screen lock: The app's controls can now be locked from the status bar so nothing gets changed by accident - in the dark, with the device in a pocket, or when handing it to someone else. Everything stays visible and keeps updating while locked; unlocking requires a 2 s long press
- Sequence editor: Items can now be saved directly from the editor
- Guiding (PHD2): The ZFilter guide algorithm is now available for the Dec axis
- Guiding: The PHD2 settings modal was replaced by a SubNav tab on the guider page
- Settings: The app settings stored on this device (language, saved instances, layout, plugin settings) can now be exported to a file and restored on another device. Equipment settings kept in the NINA/PINS profile are not included and need a separate backup
- PINS: Voltage Status & Undervoltage notification
- Hardware Compatibility plugin: Look up which hardware works with which driver, and report your own findings to a shared, crowdsourced database
- Guiding (PHD2): The Predictive PEC period length can now be set
- Status bar: Entries can be reordered and hidden under Settings > General, just like the navigation bar
- Mount: The target search under Slew now also finds stars, not just DSOs
- Nightsummary Plugin: is now also supported in NINA
- Sequence: The PHD2 Tools trigger "Interrupt and retry when RMS above" can now be configured in the app — threshold, mode, how long the guiding has to stay calm, the recovery timeout and the maximum number of repetitions
- PINS setup and settings: Configure the rig's system locale, Wi-Fi country, timezone and keyboard layout. The setup assistant reads the current Pi values and places this step before Wi-Fi; the same live settings remain available under General Settings on every client, with searchable lists of the values supported by the Pi
- Setup wizard: The first-run setup and the equipment configuration are now one guided assistant that opens automatically on first start. It covers language, the connection to your rig, and then the equipment: mount, location, telescope, camera, focuser and filter wheel. On PINS it additionally covers the rig's Wi-Fi, its software updates, the maximum slew speed and guiding. Every step writes its values straight to the profile, so nothing is lost if you leave in between
- Setup wizard: The camera step reads the sensor size from the connected camera and offers to write it into the profile if it differs from what is stored there. Cameras that do not report a sensor size - DSLRs typically - get input fields instead. Together with the pixel size, which no driver reports and which therefore always has to be entered by hand, the resulting image scale in arcsec/px is shown directly, so a mistyped value is obvious right away
- Setup wizard: The guiding step converts the dither distance for you. NINA stores it in guide camera pixels while the usual recommendations (10-15 px) are given in pixels of the imaging camera, and the two differ by a factor of 2-5 depending on the guide scope. The step shows both image scales, the resulting offset on sky and what is currently in the profile, and warns if PHD2 itself is working with a different focal length or pixel size
- Setup wizard: On PINS, every device step can install a missing 3rd party INDI driver without leaving the wizard, and the camera step lists natively supported cameras first - an INDI driver is only needed if the camera does not appear there

### Changed
- TPPA: Exposure time, gain and filter now apply to the whole rig instead of to one device - every client connected to the same instance sees the same values
- Settings: The General tab was split into Connection & Location, Interface and System, so related settings are easier to find
- Sequence: The item that is currently running can no longer be edited, disabled, reset, deleted or moved
- Sequence: Loading a sequence now closes the dialog right away and shows a spinner until the sequence is loaded
- Status bar: Entries no longer jump to the front when something needs attention, and Progress, Log and Instance are no longer pinned to the right edge
- Image history: Thumbnails load in batches while scrolling, several at a time, and are kept when you leave the tab
- Sequence: Cameras that only accept a fixed set of gain values (most Canon/Nikon DSLRs) now offer those values as a list instead of a free number field, in every exposure and flat item
- Setup: The initial setup is no longer mandatory and can be cancelled at any point. Previously every screen redirected back to the setup page until an instance had been configured; now the app stays usable and the connection can be added later under Settings. The wizard can be reopened at any time from Settings, and on PINS also from the PINS page
- 3rd party INDI drivers (PINS): Camera drivers can now be installed as well. The driver registry has always accepted the camera type, only the install dialog rejected it
- Guiding: The dither distance can now be set in steps of 0.5 pixels instead of whole pixels, because converting from imaging pixels rarely lands on a round number
- Pinsdaemon: Rework of Wifi handling

### Fixed
- Sequence editor: The save, clear and manage-sequences buttons no longer appear when connected to NINA - they only work with PINS
- Guiding: Manual VNC guide cameras now correctly set the PHD2Camera profile value
- Atlas: Camera rotation now matches NINA
- Equipment: INDI devices that only get power after the driver started (e.g. a rotator on a power box port) were listed as OFFLINE and could not be connected. The driver is now reloaded automatically instead of requiring a manual reselect in the INDI setup dialog
- Equipment: A device selection now goes straight into the profile instead of being reset by the next device list refresh, so "No device" can finally be selected
- Guiding (PHD2): On narrow screens the guiding status covered the star image and the star profile. The status is now shown at the bottom left, and both tiles adapt their size to the available width instead of being cut off
- Status bar: Panels opened from the status bar covered the lower edge of the page including its rounded corners
- Mount: With drivers that keep reporting "slewing" after a park has finished (e.g. ZWO AM5N), the mount status stayed on a red "Slewing" with an endlessly turning spinner instead of "Parked", and the slew button stayed a red stop button. A parked mount is now never shown as slewing. During a real slew the status stays green with the spinner instead of turning yellow
- Image history: Filtering (e.g. to lights only) took very long on large sessions - all images were downloaded regardless of the filter, oldest first. Only the filtered images are fetched now, starting with the ones on screen
- Webcam: Layout and settings dialog on iOS, and snapshots that stayed "Disconnected" in the app
- Livestack: The zoom and image controls could be hidden behind the status bar at the bottom of the screen
- 3rd party INDI drivers (PINS): When a search returned no packages, the driver selection and the "Edit config" button disappeared along with the results, so there was no way back without reloading. Both now stay in place and the selection is simply disabled
- Dialogs: On narrow screens content that did not fit the dialog was centred, so its left edge was cut off and could not be reached by scrolling either - in the settings dialog headings and input labels appeared clipped ("onnection Settings"). Dialog content now shrinks to the dialog width, and content that genuinely cannot shrink starts at the left edge and stays scrollable
- Celestia Atlas: Fix star constellation - Western skycultures

## [App6.1.2] - 2026-07-31

Summary of all changes since 6.0.0 (released in beta1-beta2, see below for the individual beta releases).

### Added

- Language: Catalan (ca-ES) is now available as a full app language - all 4332 texts are translated, including plugins and settings. Many thanks to @albcn for the complete translation
- Livestack (PINS): New "RGB combination" section in the livestack settings that combines three mono stacks (e.g. LRGB or SHO) of a target into a colour image, with the filter-to-channel mapping pre-filled and editable. The result appears as the "RGB" filter next to the individual channels and can be removed again. On Windows this is unchanged and still done through the plugin's own wizard, so the section only appears on PINS
- Flat Assistant: Optional target name for flats - the name can be entered directly or taken from the favorites and is then used when saving the flats. Requires TNS plugin 1.2.8.0 or newer (always available on PINS)
- Filter Offset Calculator: Warning when fewer than 3 iterations are configured - with fewer runs a failed or inaccurate AutoFocus cannot be detected and is averaged into the offset
- Filter Offset Calculator: Stopping now asks for confirmation, since all measurements taken so far are discarded and the profile is restored

### Changed

- Celestia Atlas: The photographic survey is now drawn as curved WebGL tile meshes at display resolution instead of a viewport-sized raster, and every region keeps its best already-loaded tile visible until the sharper one arrives
- Celestia Atlas: Landscapes (default and custom) are rendered on the same GPU mesh and now correctly hide celestial objects behind them instead of letting them shine through

### Fixed

- Celestia Atlas: The sky stays sharp during clicks, drags, pinches and periodic mount/view updates - no more recurring clear-to-blurry flicker, and no more isolated sharp tiles in an otherwise blurry viewport
- Celestia Atlas: The sky view now recovers on its own when the graphics context is lost (e.g. after the app has been in the background for a long time) instead of staying black
- Instance discovery: Searching for NINA instances scanned all mDNS service types at the same time, and because the native plugin only supports one search at a time, the searches cancelled each other - instances were found only sporadically or not at all. The service types are now scanned one after another, results from all of them are collected, and already-found instances stay visible while the search is still running
- Filter Offset Calculator: The offset preview now shows all filters of the profile, stated relative to the selected AutoFocus filter (which is 0). Filters that were not measured in this run keep their previous spacing, and only differences of the old offsets are used - a profile that an older build left holding absolute focuser positions no longer produces offsets in the thousands
- Filter Offset Calculator: A failed apply is now reported with an error message instead of silently doing nothing
- Settings: Values of -1 were shown as an inherited default in every numeric profile setting. This is now limited to the settings that actually use -1 as a placeholder (plate-solve gain falls back to the camera, a filter's autofocus exposure time to the focuser). Everywhere else -1 is again an ordinary value and is no longer silently replaced, and a value being edited is no longer overwritten while typing

## [App6.1.0-beta1] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Livestack (PINS): New "RGB combination" section in the livestack settings that combines three mono stacks (e.g. LRGB or SHO) of a target into a colour image, with the filter-to-channel mapping pre-filled and editable. The result appears as the "RGB" filter next to the individual channels and can be removed again. On Windows this is unchanged and still done through the plugin's own wizard, so the section only appears on PINS

## [App6.0.0] - 2026-07-30

### Breaking Changes

- Sky view: The Stellarium Web sky view has been replaced by the new Celestia Atlas renderer. The old sky view is removed - Celestia Atlas is now the only sky renderer in the app
- NINA plugin update required: Please update the Touch-N-Stars plugin in NINA to the matching version before using this release. On Android and iOS the Atlas catalogue and survey data are loaded from the NINA plugin, so with an older plugin the sky view stays empty or does not open at all
- Settings: Saved sky-view settings are migrated automatically on first start. The migration is one-way - returning to 5.x after starting 6.0.0 will not restore the old Stellarium settings
- Landscapes: Generated plugin landscapes now use an update-safe persistent data route instead of the replaceable application asset directory and are moved there automatically. Stellarium landscape files remain supported through the landscape creator plugin

### Added

- Celestia Atlas: Complete offline M1-M110 coverage, a dedicated Messier catalogue filter, and designation-plus-common-name labels such as "M81 - Bode's Galaxy"
- Celestia Atlas: Independent persisted limiting-magnitude controls for stars, galaxies and other deep-sky objects; lower values keep only brighter objects and Auto preserves adaptive field-of-view filtering
- Celestia Atlas: Search and render 8,658 supplemental Abell/ACO, Barnard, LBN, LDN, RCW, Sharpless 2 and vdB objects, 86 SIMBAD A66 planetary nebulae and 8,780 HYG stars from package-local data without requiring a network
- Celestia Atlas: Selected catalogue targets now expose aliases and the complete favorite, Framing Assistant, sequence-target, slew/center/rotate and mount-sync workflow through the existing Touch-N-Stars action panel
- Celestia Atlas: Persist independent marker filters for 17 deep-sky object types and nine offline catalogue sources, including separate Abell/ACO galaxy cluster and Abell planetary-nebula controls

### Changed

- Celestia Atlas: Defer engine/catalogue loading until first open, retain one paused warm viewer after that, split the compact OpenNGC, supplemental DSO, Abell planetary-nebula, HYG and curated bright-sky payloads into first-open chunks, and reduce mobile panorama, search, FOV sampling and lifecycle work
- Celestia Atlas: Make the shared selected-target panel safe-area aware and independently scrollable on short mobile landscape screens; its favorite dialog now renders at the application root instead of inside the sky overlay
- Logfile collector plugin: Description is now mandatory

### Fixed

- Celestia Atlas: Render the complete photographic survey viewport at
  display-aware resolution and load visible HiPS tiles with higher parallelism,
  eliminating the isolated sharp-tile appearance on web, Android and iOS
- Celestia Atlas: Keep photographic survey imagery sharp during clicks, drags,
  pinches and periodic mount/view updates. Completed high-resolution frames are
  retained until the next reprojection is ready, eliminating the recurring
  clear-to-blurry flicker on web, Android and iOS
- Celestia Atlas: Correct J2000/ICRS-to-horizontal geometry with precession, nutation and observed sidereal orientation, keeping landscapes, the Milky Way horizon mask, grids and horizontal navigation on one cached frame
- Celestia Atlas: Keep camera and mosaic position angles anchored to projected celestial north while the embedded view follows the local horizon
- Celestia Atlas: Route view-center slew, center, rotate, sequence and favorite actions through the proven J2000 command boundary; invalid or untagged view coordinates now disable the actions instead of reusing stale values
- Celestia Atlas: Convert ICRS catalogue selections to the J2000 frame required by NINA framing and mount commands, while retaining source-frame provenance and rejecting untagged coordinates
- Celestia Atlas: Correct the mirrored Galactic-longitude mapping so the Milky Way crosses the local horizon in the expected north-to-south direction
- Celestia Atlas: Keep the embedded view explicitly horizon-aligned even when both coordinate-grid overlays are hidden, so landscapes stay level and horizontal drags follow azimuth instead of appearing to rotate the sky
- Celestia Atlas: The selected-target framing action now opens the actual Framing Assistant and retains J2000 epoch plus ICRS/J2000 source-frame provenance instead of sending the user to the mount slew tab

## [App5.3.0-beta1] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Multi-instance: Switching instances - and editing the IP/port of the active instance - now restarts the app instead of resetting parts of it in place. You stay on the page you were on. Note that a running TPPA alignment or manual mount control session is no longer carried over to the new instance

### Fixed

- Multi-instance: Data from the previously selected instance could be left over after switching (framing target, mount, flat assistant, histogram and most plugin views were never cleared)
- Multi-instance: WebSocket and SignalR connections sometimes failed to re-establish after switching instances
- UI: Short white flash while the app loads (on start and when switching instances) - the dark background now applies from the very first frame

## [App5.2.0] - 2026-07-26

Summary of all changes since 5.1.0 (released in beta1-beta4, see below for the individual beta releases).

### Added

- Safety: Destructive actions now ask for confirmation before running - parking the mount and clearing the whole sequence
- Haptics: Light/medium haptic feedback on native (Android/iOS) platforms when triggering key actions such as capture, slew, park and stop
- Guiding: PHD2 live image can now be zoomed and panned (pinch, mouse wheel, double-tap) like the camera image, with lock position, guiding cross and secondary star overlays tracking correctly, plus a reset-zoom button
- Equipment (PINS): Connect button now doubles as a cancel button while a connection attempt is in progress
- TPPA (PINS): When the alignment view is opened (or after switching instances), the running state is now loaded from the backend, so an alignment already in progress is reflected correctly instead of relying on a possibly stale saved state

### Changed

- Design: App-wide visual refresh onto a single design system - one consistent set of button styles, surfaces and colors with a single cyan accent, and green/yellow/red now always carry the same meaning across the app (running / attention / problem or stopped). Buttons, inputs and other touch targets are now at least 48px for easier tapping in the field
- Navigation: Each nav item now shows a permanent label under its icon (previously the label only appeared while touching), and the landscape sidebar is narrower so it no longer wastes empty space next to the icons
- Status bar: Redesigned, taller status bar that shows camera, mount, guider, filter, weather and progress state - and their key values - at a glance without having to tap a chip first
- Layout: Pages now sit inside a fixed, rounded frame with corner accents while content scrolls beneath it, replacing leftover full-page backgrounds and stray top padding from the old layout
- Info panels: Stat tiles simplified to semantic states, with a more compact two-column view on smaller pages
- Camera: Live/captured image view is now contained within the rounded frame instead of overflowing it
- Camera: Cooler status revised
- Sequence Creator: Toolbar buttons (undo/redo, save, library, clear, send to NINA) restyled to match the app-wide design system

### Fixed

- Dialog: Minimized dialogs are now a small, draggable chip anchored above the status bar instead of a fixed 300px box that permanently covered the bottom-right corner
- Sequence: Sequence control buttons no longer get covered when a status bar panel (progress, camera/mount/filter info, guider graph) is opened - they now shift up above it automatically
- Sequence Creator: Camera offset field was limited to -100..100, now allows the full 0-10000 range
- Sequence Creator: Cool Camera action sent -10°C to NINA instead of the configured target temperature when it was set to 0°C
- Sequence Creator: Actions added to a sequence before a template's min/max/step was changed no longer keep showing stale bounds - they now pick up the current limits
- Sequence Creator: "Wait if Sun/Moon Altitude" always showed 0.0° and never showed the expected time - now shows the actual current altitude and expected time
- Sequence Creator: "Moon Altitude" condition was missing the current altitude display that its Sun Altitude counterpart already had
- Multi-instance: A running snapshot loop no longer keeps capturing against the new instance after switching (or against the same instance after a brief connection loss) - it is now stopped as part of the connection teardown
- Multi-instance: The guider graph and sequence editor no longer freeze after a connection is lost and comes back (WiFi blip, background/resume, or switching instances) while those views are open - they now resume on their own
- Multi-instance: The last captured image is no longer left over from the previous instance when switching, and TPPA's saved filter/gain/exposure settings are now kept per instance instead of leaking between them
- PINS: Fixed plugin layout

- Multi-instance: A running snapshot loop no longer keeps capturing against the new instance after switching (or against the same instance after a brief connection loss) - it is now stopped as part of the connection teardown
- Multi-instance: The guider graph and sequence editor no longer freeze after a connection is lost and comes back (WiFi blip, background/resume, or switching instances) while those views are open - they now resume on their own
- Multi-instance: The last captured image is no longer left over from the previous instance when switching, and TPPA's saved filter/gain/exposure settings are now kept per instance instead of leaking between them

## [App5.1.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Settings: New "Local Network Binding" option (Android) to keep the app connected via Wi-Fi when the NINA instance runs on a local network without internet (e.g. PINS hotspot), while the rest of the phone keeps using mobile data

### Changed

- Build: Pin TypeScript 6.0.3 because the current `vue-tsc` wrapper cannot load
  the TypeScript 7 compiler export; lint, typecheck and production build pass

### Fixed

- Stellarium: Fixed the sky view flickering and mouse-wheel zoom appearing broken in Chrome by removing the frame rate cap while Stellarium is visible
- Sequence: Three Point Polar Alignment item now shows the actually selected filter instead of always appearing empty
- Guider: PHD2 exposure field no longer shows NaN when the initial exposure request fails

## [App5.0.0-beta12] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Stellarium: Fixed the sky view suddenly zooming and then freezing (no more pan/zoom) after a few touch gestures on iPadOS - the browser could claim the gesture and cancel the touch without the engine ever seeing it end, leaving a phantom finger "held down"

## [App5.0.0-beta9 and 10] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- TPPA: Filter can now be selected in the alignment settings and is passed to the start-alignment request (leave on "Default" to use NINA's defaults)
- Mount: Telescope settle time setting in the mount settings panel
- PINS: WiFi card now shows the current connection (SSID, IP address, interface, band) with signal strength and a short history graph - thanks to acocalypso

### Changed

- Background handling: Guider stats/graph, dark library build progress, the sequence editor, PINS device list, PINS AllSky, system metrics, INDI Control Panel, log collector and framing polling now all pause while the app is in the background (via a new shared polling composable) instead of continuing to poll, and resume only if they were actually active before pausing

### Fixed

- PINS: WiFi connect/disconnect buttons now reflect the actual connection state - no longer offer to "connect" to a network you're already connected to, and disconnect is styled distinctly while connected
- PINS: Fixed a re-probe race that could double-check or miss PINS availability, plus poller start/stop races and an unsafe framing data access
- Camera: Fixed "Center Here" always treating the connected camera as a DSLR, which broke the sensor-size fallback for cameras that do report a native sensor size
- Guider: PHD2 calibration data button is no longer shown outside PINS mode

## [App5.0.0-beta8] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- Connection: All WebSocket connections (event channel, mount control, TPPA) now share a single reconnect engine with exponential backoff instead of a fixed 2-second retry, so a backend that is temporarily unreachable is no longer hammered every 2 seconds while still recovering promptly once it returns
- Connection: Reworked the reconnect screen to be calmer and more useful - a brief background/foreground blip now only shows a neutral spinner, escalating to a friendlier message with "Retry now" and "Settings" actions (technical connection details tucked behind an optional "Show details") only if it's still not reachable after a few seconds; the "this may indicate a problem" warning now only appears after 15s instead of 10s, since reconnecting after being backgrounded can normally take up to ~12s on its own

### Fixed

- Connection: Event subscriptions (new images, live stacking updates) are now re-established after every reconnect - previously a reconnect handled internally could silently stop delivering these events until the app was restarted
- Connection: Detect and recover "zombie" connections where the socket looks open but no longer receives anything (e.g. after switching between WiFi and mobile data while the app stays in the foreground)
- Connection: The mount control connection no longer keeps retrying every 2 seconds while the backend is unreachable, and now recovers on its own once it comes back without needing to leave and re-open the page
- Connection: The TPPA alignment connection now reconnects through a single path (a duplicate retry loop was removed) and its pending reconnect can now be properly cancelled
- Connection: Overlapping WebSocket reconnect attempts no longer cancel each other out every ~2 seconds, so reconnecting after resume is noticeably faster
- Connection: The reconnect screen now shows immediately when returning from background instead of briefly showing stale data before the connection-error banner appears a few seconds later, but only after a brief grace period so a near-instant reconnect no longer flashes the overlay at all
- Connection: A short-timeout WebSocket connect attempt could silently claim the shared reconnect slot and cap every subsequent attempt at its shorter timeout; reconnect timeouts are now consistent everywhere
- Connection: Disconnecting no longer leaves a stale pending connection reference behind that could cause the next reconnect attempt to wait on an already-dying connection
- Connection: The four SignalR services (PINS notifications, progress, dialogs, message boxes) no longer run two competing reconnect mechanisms at once

## [App5.0.0-beta7] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- Connection: App no longer gets stuck showing "trying to reconnect" indefinitely after returning from a locked screen if an earlier resume attempt was still in progress - the pending reconnect is now retried instead of silently dropped
- Connection: Fixed a race between overlapping WebSocket reconnect attempts that could permanently freeze the backend status polling after resuming from background, requiring an app restart to recover

## [App5.0.0-beta6] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Settings: New $$FWHM$$ and $$ECCENTRICITY$$ tokens for the image file pattern

### Fixed

- Diagnostics: Mobile diagnostic ZIP downloads now work on mobile devices
- Connection: Mount and TPPA WebSockets no longer keep delivering events from a stale socket after a reconnect; polling loops now skip a tick instead of overlapping when a request is still in flight

## [App5.0.0-beta5] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Sequence: PHD2 calibration slew item – slew to a guider calibration position (HA offset, Dec, pointing side, optional DEC backlash clearing)
- Guider: Prompt to reconnect the guider after toggling PHD2 auto restore calibration, since the setting only takes effect after a reconnect
- TPPA: Alignment warnings for huge/large polar alignment errors, declination spread between measurements, and correction fields close to East/West
- Stellarium: Loading spinner while the engine initializes

### Changed

- Stellarium: Skip rendering while the view is hidden or the app is in the background instead of letting the WebGL engine render continuously, significantly reducing battery drain and device heat; the view stays loaded and resumes instantly

### Fixed

- Narrowband Filter: Correct aperture and focal length limitation in the filter calculator
- Framing: Compute visible stars once on load instead of reactively

## [App5.0.0-beta4] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Plugin: INDI Control Panel – inspect and control every property of the INDI drivers currently loaded on the server
- Equipment: HTTP connection mode for INDI mounts (in addition to Serial and Network/TCP)
- PINS: INDI registry edit config flow – edit Name, Label and Type of installed INDI 3rd-party registry entries via a mobile-friendly modal, patching only changed fields and preserving unsaved edits across refresh - thanks to acocalypso
